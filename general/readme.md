# General

_These items are mandatory and must be followed to the letter._

## Tabs

Hard tabs for indenting, spaces for alignment

## Grunt
We use Grunt for task running. You can find a Gruntfile.js and package.json file in the skeleton repo.

Use SVG sprites for icons. The Grunt configurations found in the skeleton repo includes SVG icon generation. 
Both WordPress and Shopify skeleton themes include functions for easily calling icons from the icon sprite.
